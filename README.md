# She's Not Here

As part of Girls Who Code final project, 5 girls -- Amy, Nishat, Edie, Teresa, and Janny -- from the Moody's NYC 2015 cohort, created She's Not Here.
Built with Crafty.JS and HTML, She's Not Here is a 2D scrolling pixel game about fighting ones inner demons and breaking free.
Integrating the zodiac signs and other mystical inspirations, we developed a mission to raise trans visibility in video games by making our main character transgender.
